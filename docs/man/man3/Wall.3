.SS "void Wall::C_Destroyed ()\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
A callback called upon deletion\&. Guarnteed to be ran in the same tick as your death\&. Guarnteed to run on the phyiscs thread\&.
.PP
Attempting to access memory from this physics object after this function is called is undefined behaviour\&. In most circumstances, you will want to remove yourself from anythingthat utilizes lists of physics objects (minimap, glue, serialization, etc\&.)
.PP
This is for tasks such as removing yourself from a minimap, or informing the serialization manager that you're dead\&. Doing this in a destructor is undefined behaviour, as the time between a physics object dying and actually being deallocated is non-deterministic and may happen on another thread\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBGE_PhysicsObject\fP\&.
.SS "\fBVector2\fP Wall::getSize ()\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This should be implemented if you set the 'resizeEnabled' property is set 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBGE_LevelEditorInterface\fP\&.
.SS "void Wall::setSize (\fBVector2\fP size)\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
