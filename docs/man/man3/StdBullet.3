.SS "void StdBullet::C_Destroyed ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
A callback called upon deletion\&. Guarnteed to be ran in the same tick as your death\&. Guarnteed to run on the phyiscs thread\&.
.PP
Attempting to access memory from this physics object after this function is called is undefined behaviour\&. In most circumstances, you will want to remove yourself from anythingthat utilizes lists of physics objects (minimap, glue, serialization, etc\&.)
.PP
This is for tasks such as removing yourself from a minimap, or informing the serialization manager that you're dead\&. Doing this in a destructor is undefined behaviour, as the time between a physics object dying and actually being deallocated is non-deterministic and may happen on another thread\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBGE_PhysicsObject\fP\&.
