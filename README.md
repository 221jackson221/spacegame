# About

It's JUST STARS. There's no spaceship. I guarntee it. There's nothing. There's no physics engine running in the background. Absolutely none. Because it's just stars. This isn't some crappy version I made by commenting out the renderer. This is an application designed for stars, by stars, from the stars up.

# Style

The syntax for functions is pretty much the same as SDL. GE_CreateStructName , GE_FreeStructName . 
new and delete are used. 

Callbacks are C_Name

Array counts are numArrayName

Code is documented with Doxygen
