Glue is a threadsafe method of copying trivially copiable data from the physics engine to the rendering engine threads. It utilizes a single buffer both ways.

p = physics engine thread
r = render engine thread

Beggining of a physics tick:
Data from r-buffer tranfered to p.

End of a physics tick:

Data from p tranfered to p-buffer

Beginning of a render tick:

Data from o-buffer tranfered to r

End of a render tick:

Data from r transfered to r-buffer
